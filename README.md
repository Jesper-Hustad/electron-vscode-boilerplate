## Goal

Replace `my-app` with your own name.

cd ./my-app
npm install
npm start
```




## Issues
- [ ] Haven't tested mac, need to make sure it looks good on there
- [ ] Clean up code, refactoring required
- [ ] Show more functionality of boilerplate.  
  - buttons  
  - [x] accent color variable
  - more?

- [ ] Add titlebar items like file, edit, etc... (not 100% necessary)
