A clean simple BitTorrent client

![](screenshot.jpg)

## Issue to solve
Current popular clients are made primarily for advanced users.
They include features that most people don't need.
Some have ads and some haven't changed UI since they were released decades ago.

## Design
- Dark theme
- Clean and modern
- VS code inspired look

## Required features
- Shortcuts for pause, start, open in folder, and delete any torrent.  
  Up down with j/k, spacebar to pause/start
- Manage torrent files such as priority and only downloading partially
- Reliable torrenting backend library, torrent-stream looks promising

## Game plan
- Write in Electron to make all platforms supported and keep it simple
- Take insperation from "Electron-Torrent" project that has implemented torrents in electron
- A static site for easy downloading, no building or looking trough directories required


## Notes
- The screenshot is entirely made in illustrator and is simply a visualization of what the goal is.  
- Design can be changed, but a dark theme modern look is still the goal.  
- Other applications can get close to something like this, but they require installing themes and are a hassle.  
  You can't beat a applications design that has been built from the ground up and implemented in every step.
